## Some notes along the way...

### Day 1
Sadly, I haven't done anything in Python since last year's AoC. I'm definitely rusty.
(Solved part 2 in February: not elegant but functional.)

### Day 2
It's been another while -- now February 2024.
I am so pleased that I solved this puzzle in a short afternoon.  That's a confidence boost. 

### Day 7
July 2024.  I haven't been making notes, oops. 
I am again pleased with myself, this time for using a custom class to solve this puzzle. Defining the class (and the 
functions necessary to compare instances) was a little clumsy, but once that's done the actual work of solving the 
puzzle becomes trivial. That's the nicest feeling.

### Day 8
Part 1 wasn't too hard to solve by myself, but part 2 is clearly beyond brute force.  After reading some other people's 
solutions, and then some analyses of why those solutions worked, I came back and wrote a little script that worked.
Lesson: Don't reinvent the wheel; learn from the skills of those who came before you, and use their libraries.
